    "# Part 1 - Making CAD with CadQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python module for building parametric 3D CAD models. Using CadQuery, you can write short, simple scripts that produce high quality CAD models. It is easy to make many different objects using a single script that can be customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details can be found\n",
    "- On the documentation https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "- On GitHub https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery/\n",
    "\n",
    "CadQuery is particular well suited to fusion neutronics:\n",
    "- CadQuery is used by [cad-to-dagmc](https://github.com/fusion-energy/cad_to_dagmc) to convert CAD geometry to DAGMC neutronics geometry\n",
    "- Cadquery can pass geometry in memory to popular meshing software GMsh\n",
    "- CadQuery can tag surfaces and volumes so that their tags appear in the meshes and can automate boundary condition assignment in engineering workflows\n",
    "- CadQuery is easy to install with pip or conda"
